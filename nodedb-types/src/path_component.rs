//! Validation for names that become a single filesystem path component.
//!
//! Collection names, partition directory names, and segment file names all
//! arrive from outside the process — SQL DDL, a Raft `InstallSnapshot` blob, a
//! RESTORE payload — and are then joined onto a data directory. A name that is
//! not a single plain component escapes that directory: `..` walks out of it,
//! an embedded separator writes into a subtree the caller never named, and a
//! leading `/` discards the base entirely (`Path::join` replaces the whole path
//! on an absolute argument). Since the same names are also passed to
//! `remove_dir_all`, an unchecked one deletes outside the data directory too.
//!
//! Every path builder that joins an externally supplied name calls
//! [`is_plain_path_component`] first and raises its own domain error, so the
//! rejection names the payload that carried the bad name.

/// Whether `name` is safe to join onto a directory as exactly one component.

/// Accepts a non-empty name that is not `.` or `..`, carries no path separator

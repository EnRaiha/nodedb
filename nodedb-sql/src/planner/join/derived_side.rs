//! A derived table as a JOIN side: `JOIN (SELECT ...) AS b ON ...`, on
//! either side of any join, including the FROM side of a multi-way join.
//!
//! The side is the subquery's plan, named by its alias. It is planned as a
//! one-definition CTE whose outer query is a scan of the alias:
//! `Cte { definitions: [(b, body)], outer: Scan { collection: b, alias: b } }`.
//! The scan keeps the alias, which is the qualifier of the side's columns
//! in the joined row, and the CTE lowering embeds the body's rows as the
//! join input.

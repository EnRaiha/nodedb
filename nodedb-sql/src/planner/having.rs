//! HAVING planning: bind the predicate to computed aggregate columns.
//!
//! A HAVING predicate is evaluated against finalized group rows, so every
//! aggregate it mentions must (a) actually be computed and (b) be addressed by
//! the column name it lands under.
//!
//! Left untranslated, `HAVING SUM(amount) > 0` reaches the executor as a
//! literal `sum(...)` *call* over a group row that has no such column and no
//! scalar `sum` to apply — every group fails the predicate and the query
//! returns nothing, for data that plainly satisfies it. And an aggregate named
//! only in HAVING was never added to the aggregate list, so it was never
//! computed at all.
//!
//! HAVING filters *before* aggregates are renamed to their user aliases, so it
//! binds to the canonical key.

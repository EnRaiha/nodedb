    ///    ephemeral QUIC + pgwire ports, 1 core, the SAME cluster config as
    ///    the original members — including the low

    ///    cluster-init dispatcher takes the **join** path: the node sends a
    ///    `RaftRpc::JoinRequest` to the seed.
    ///
    /// 2. The seed's `RaftLoop::join_flow` (running on its live transport)
    ///    is the real conf-change driver:
    ///    - registers the joiner's address on the leader's transport
    ///      (`transport.register_peer`) so the leader can immediately
    ///      `AppendEntries` / `InstallSnapshot` to it,
    ///    - admits it into topology, then proposes
    ///      `ConfChange::AddLearner(new_node_id)` on **every** Raft group
    ///      the node is missing (metadata + every data group),
    ///    - waits for each conf-change to commit, persists topology +
    ///      routing, and broadcasts a `TopologyUpdate` to every active peer
    ///      so the *other* existing nodes also learn the joiner's address
    ///      (peer wiring in both directions).
    ///
    ///    The `JoinResponse` carries the post-`AddLearner` routing, and the
    ///    joining node reconstructs its local `MultiRaft` with each data
    ///    group started in the `Learner` role (`add_group_as_learner`).

    ///    leader tick, the leader sees the learner's `next_index` is below
    ///    its compacted `snapshot_index`, so it cannot use `AppendEntries`
    ///    and instead builds a real per-group snapshot via the installed
    ///    `DataPlaneSnapshotBuilder` and streams it with `InstallSnapshot`.

//! One-shot RPC dispatch arms extracted from [`super::server::handle_stream`].
//!
//! Each arm in [`try_handle_oneshot_rpc`] corresponds to a single
//! request/response exchange that does NOT need access to the inbound
//! [`quinn::RecvStream`] — it reads its single request frame from the
//! already-decoded [`RaftRpc`] value, calls the handler, encodes the response,
//! and finishes the send stream.
//!
//! Arms that read additional frames from `recv` live elsewhere: the
//! `ExecuteStreamRequest` arm in `server.rs` and the `ShufflePushRequest`
//! arm in `shuffle_drain.rs`.

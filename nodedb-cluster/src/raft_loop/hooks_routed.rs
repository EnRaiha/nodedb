/// `nodedb-cluster` cannot depend on `nodedb` (circular), so the assign logic —
/// run a LOCAL `SurrogateAssigner::assign` for the `(collection, pk)` endpoint
/// key carried by the request — lives in `nodedb` behind this `Send + Sync` hook.
/// The transport read-loop calls [`on_assign_surrogate`](Self::on_assign_surrogate)
/// when an `AssignSurrogateRequest` arrives at the home vShard's LEADER and writes
/// the returned [`AssignSurrogateResponse`](crate::rpc_codec::AssignSurrogateResponse)
/// back to the coordinator.
///
/// Because the handler runs on the home node (the vShard leader), a LOCAL assign
/// yields the AUTHORITATIVE surrogate: the first call allocates it and every later
/// call for the same key returns the same value (idempotent, first-wins). The
/// coordinator routes here precisely so the value it carries is the one the home
/// node will store under.
///
/// Cluster-only tests leave the `RaftLoop` field `None`; an `AssignSurrogate`
/// request against a node with no assigner installed returns a typed "not
/// configured" error.
///
/// The hook is **async** for signature symmetry with the other one-shot hooks;
/// the host-crate implementation performs a synchronous local assign (the
/// `SurrogateAssigner` is a sync `Send + Sync` facade) and never touches
/// io_uring or the Data Plane directly.

//! The leader's side of multi-part transactions: opening their part
//! streams, proposing the parts they stream in, and abandoning the ones no
//! stream will finish.
//!
//! The leader opens a transaction's stream once its header's epoch batch is
//! proposed. The coordinator streams the parts into the shared
//! [`PartsIntake`], whose byte cap bounds the leader's memory. The leader
//! proposes queued parts in order on each tick.
//!
//! - Fairness: one tick proposes parts up to `max_bytes_per_epoch` bytes, at
//!   least one part. Epoch batches keep their cadence between them. A part
//!   carries a position fixed by its header, so it never reorders anything on
//!   the vShards it shares with later transactions: their flushes wait for it
//!   by position.
//! - A failed proposal puts the part back for the next tick.
//! - A node that stops leading closes every stream. A leader whose term
//!   changed closes the streams of the old term: Raft can drop an earlier
//!   term's proposals. A stream that stalls is closed too.
//! - A leader abandons every open transaction whose stream it does not
//!   hold: one another leader sequenced, one this node sequenced before a
//!   restart or a term change, or one whose stream closed. The abandonment
//!   applies only while the transaction is open, so a last part that commits
//!   first wins.
//!
//! A stream stays open until every part is proposed, its header applied,
//! and the transaction closed in the state machine, so the leader never
//! abandons a transaction it is still carrying.

//! Plans too large for one sequencer entry, carried as ordered parts.
//!
//! A multi-part transaction is sequenced once, by a header in an epoch batch.
//! The header is the transaction's [`TxClass`] with its full read and write
//! sets and no plans, so every participant takes all its locks at the
//! header's position. Its plans travel as [`PlanPart`]s, each in its own
//! `SequencerEntry::TxnPart` after the header. A participant stages the
//! transaction once every part that targets it has arrived.
//!
//! - A part holds consecutive whole tasks, encoded as the plan batch a
//!   single-entry transaction carries in `plans`. `first_task` is the index
//!   of its first task in the whole transaction.
//! - A task too large for one part travels as a run of chunk parts. Each
//!   holds one byte range of the task's own encoding and nothing else.
//! - A part targets the vShards its tasks route to. Only those receive it.
//! - The header's manifest names how many parts target each participant, so
//!   a participant knows when it holds all of its parts.
//!
//! The coordinator streams the parts to the sequencer leader after it
//! submits the header. The manifest names the stream.

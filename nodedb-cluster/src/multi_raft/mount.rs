//! Mounting a Raft group: the disk work apart from the `MultiRaft` lock.
//!
//! A mount opens the group's redb log and reloads its hard state and log.
//! That is disk work, so a mount on a running node takes three steps:
//! 1. [`MultiRaft::mount_spec`] under the lock copies what the group needs;
//! 2. [`GroupMountSpec::open`] off the async threads and without the lock
//!    opens and restores the group;
//! 3. [`MultiRaft::insert_opened`] under the lock mounts it.
//!
//! Boot and tests mount through [`MultiRaft::add_group`], which runs the
//! three steps in a row.

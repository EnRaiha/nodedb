//! Fail-stop-on-readiness-gate-failure boot regression.
//!
//! When a boot-path readiness gate fails, the process must exit non-zero, the
//! same contract the graceful shutdown path already guarantees via the
//! explicit `std::process::exit(0)` in `main.rs`. The boot-ERROR path has no
//! such explicit exit: `await_cluster_ready(...).await?` propagates `Err` out
//! of `server_main` and relies on `main` returning, which is not guaranteed to
//! terminate the process — Data Plane cores run on plain `std::thread`, so a
//! panicked core thread does not unwind the Tokio runtime, and any background
//! Tokio task still running (health loop, scheduler, etc.) keeps the runtime
//! alive when `main` drops it on the way out. The observed symptom is a
//! process that stays alive with every listener port closed, requiring an
//! external force-stop to recover.
//!
//! This test forces exactly that: a WAL-replay fail point panics the sole
//! Data Plane core's thread before it signals replay completion, which drops
//! the `replay_done` sender. `bootstrap/cluster_ready.rs` turns that into
//! "data plane core exited before signalling WAL replay completion" and fails
//! the `data-groups-replay` gate, which must fail-stop the whole process.
//! Requires `--features failpoints`.

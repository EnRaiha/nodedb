//! The system dispatch door stays closed to client-reachable code.
//!
//! `SystemTask` exists so a caller that reaches the Data Plane without a user
//! identity has to say why. That only holds while the set of callers is work
//! the server genuinely originates itself — retention, backup, cluster
//! snapshot, DDL apply, catalog maintenance, tenant lifecycle, Event Plane
//! rules, and legs of an already-admitted request.
//!
//! Rust's module privacy cannot express "only these unrelated modules may
//! construct this": `pub(in path)` requires an ancestor module, and every
//! caller here lives outside `sync_dispatch`'s ancestry. So the boundary is
//! enforced here instead — a new construction site has to be added to the
//! allowlist deliberately, in a file whose whole purpose is to make someone
//! think about whether a client can reach it.
//!
//! If this test fails, do not simply extend the list. Ask first whether the new
//! caller has an identity available. If it does, it belongs on the authorized
//! path (`user_dispatch::dispatch_for_identity`), not here.

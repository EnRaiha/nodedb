//! Native-protocol SELECT against a `Shadowed` clone must see the source
//! row: the clone CoW read-interception hook runs from the protocol-neutral
//! `shared::clone_read` module, reached from every dispatch entry point
//! through `intercept_and_authorize` — not only pgwire.
//!
//! Before the read-side hook existed, `intercept_and_authorize` had no
//! clone-read branch at all, so a native SELECT against a Shadowed clone's
//! target (which holds zero rows until a write copies one up) dispatched
//! straight through and returned zero rows. This test fails without the fix
//! and passes with it.
//!
//! Setup runs over pgwire; the read under test runs over native — see
//! `native_clone_write_intercept.rs` for why the clone-scoped session
//! authenticates its database on `OpCode::Auth` rather than `USE DATABASE`.

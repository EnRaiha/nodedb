//! The commit HLC of WAL records a metadata entry's apply appends.

//! The metadata applier applies each entry inside one task, and awaits every
//! effect the entry has (a collection purge's tombstone, for one) inside that
//! task. While it applies a stamped entry, every record the task appends
//! without a commit HLC of its own carries the entry's stamp. A cluster
//! restore then keeps such a record exactly when it keeps the entry.
//!
//! The stamp is task-local, so it follows the apply across await points and
//! worker threads. Code outside any task reads no stamp.

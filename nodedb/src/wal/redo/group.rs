//! The record group of one write, and the node cascade sub-record.
//!
//! A write that stores rows its apply decides journals them after apply, in
//! one or more `WriteGroup` part records. Every part names the write's
//! origin: the write's forward record, which an announcing `WriteGroup`
//! record follows, or the opening `WriteGroup` record the write appended
//! before dispatch. A group is whole when every part it announced is present.
//! A point-in-time restore keeps a group only whole (see
//! [`GroupMembership`]). Boot settles every group the log shows broken before
//! any replay: it journals the parts the core stored beside the write's
//! effects, or cancels a write whose effects never became durable (see
//! `crate::bootstrap::write_group_settle`). Restart replay then applies every
//! record present.
//!
//! The Event Plane names every event of the write by the origin's LSN, on the
//! live path and in WAL catch-up alike.

//! The column a collection's rows render their identity under.
//!
//! A row with a declared key carries its identity under that key. A row with
//! no declared key carries it under `id`. The Control Plane resolves the
//! declared key from the catalog and ships it on `DocumentOp::Register`, so
//! the Data Plane reads it from `doc_configs` and never from the catalog.
//!
//! Every reader that gives a sparse row its identity takes the column from
//! here: the scan row, the filter image, the `RETURNING` row, and the event
//! image. A row then never shows an `id` beside its declared key, and a
//! predicate naming the declared key finds it.

//! Make a snapshot install durable before the core acknowledges it.
//!
//! A snapshot install writes no WAL records. Engine state it leaves only in
//! memory has no copy a restart can rebuild it from, so every memory-only
//! engine the install writes is checkpointed here: KV, CRDT, columnar,
//! timeseries memtables, vectors, and spatial R-trees. The redb-backed stores
//! (documents, full-text postings, graph edges) commit durably at write time
//! and need no step.
//!
//! Unlike the coordinated checkpoint, a failed flush is an error here, not a
//! clamp: an install whose state is not durable must not be acknowledged,
//! because the caller then moves the Raft durable floor past it.

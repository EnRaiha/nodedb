//! The single site where startup WAL replay gives up on a committed record.
//!
//! Every record handed to a `replay_*_wal` arm has already had its CRC
//! verified by the WAL reader, and every record in the replayed suffix was
//! acknowledged to a client as committed. So a record that an engine arm
//! cannot decode, cannot route, or whose handler rejects is not a damaged byte
//! range to step over — it is a committed write that this build cannot apply.
//! Continuing past it opens the database with a hole in the replayed suffix
//! that no later read can distinguish from data that was never written.
//!
//! Recovery therefore stops. The core fail-stops with
//! [`FailStopCause::ReplayRecordUnapplied`]: every replay arm applies no
//! record once the core is stopped, a stopped core publishes no checkpoint,
//! and `replay_all_wal` returns the halt to its caller as an error. Boot then
//! refuses to start, exactly as it does for a redo group replay cannot
//! reconstitute and for a partially-recovered sync HWM idempotency gate. The
//! forensic report is filed here rather than at each call site, so one WAL
//! tail that fails identically on every core files one growing report.

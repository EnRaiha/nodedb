//! A direct write whose collection fires a BEFORE, INSTEAD OF or SYNC AFTER
//! body, in the statement's transaction.
//!
//! The write's tasks run through the SQL path's per-task loop, which routes
//! each one through the shared `txn_route`: the bodies join the transaction,
//! a shadowed clone takes its copy-on-write steps, and the writes stage.
//! Inside a transaction block that is the client's transaction. Outside one
//! it is an implicit transaction that commits when every task succeeds and
//! rolls back when one fails.

//! Per-vShard order fence for row writes: document rows and graph edges.
//!
//! A row write journals its rows at one of two instants:
//!
//! - before dispatch, when the plan carries the row (a point put, insert or
//!   delete): the record's LSN is minted right before the enqueue;
//! - after apply, from `Response::write_set`, when the apply decides the row
//!   (an update's post-image, a predicate's row set, a versioned row's
//!   stamp, an edge version's ordinal): the record's LSN is minted once the
//!   response arrives.
//!
//! Replay applies the records in LSN order. For any two writes that touch one
//! row, the order of their records must therefore equal the order the core
//! applied them in. The core applies a vShard's writes in enqueue order, so
//! a write's records must be minted after every record of the writes enqueued
//! before it, and before every record of the writes enqueued after it.
//!
//! A single-row write holds its row's key from before its first mint through
//! its last one: the admission guard, or the keyed order lock this module
//! takes when admission handed out none. Two writes of one row therefore
//! never interleave. A write whose rows no single key covers — a predicate,
//! batch or join write, a truncate, a balance fold, a committed transaction,
//! a point write that folds a materialized-sum target, an edge batch or a
//! cross-home edge — takes the vShard's fence exclusive over the same window.
//! Every other row write takes it shared. No row write of the vShard mints or
//! enqueues while an exclusive holder runs, and an exclusive holder waits for
//! every shared one.
//!
//! The window is held across the Data-Plane round-trip, never across the
//! group-commit fsync: the funnel waits for durability after release.

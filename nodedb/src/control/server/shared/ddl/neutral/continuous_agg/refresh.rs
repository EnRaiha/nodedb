//! Protocol-neutral `REFRESH CONTINUOUS AGGREGATE <name>` handler.
//!
//! The refresh is a cut: a replicated write on the data group of the
//! aggregate's root source. Every replica applies it in log order, flushes
//! the root's memtable, and folds exactly the partitions present at that
//! moment. So every replica, and every node after a failover, serves the
//! same refresh point.
//!
//! The handler proposes the cut, then waits for it to fold on the core
//! that owns the root's vShard. That core folds under the per-tick budget
//! while it holds the wait, so the refresh never blocks the core. The
//! statement deadline bounds the wait.
//!
//! Both steps run where the root's group lives. A node that replicates the
//! group proposes the cut, waits for its own replica to apply it, and waits
//! for the fold on its own core. A node that does not replicate the group
//! sends each step through the gateway to the group's leader.
//!
//! The caller needs read access to the root source, and ownership of the
//! aggregate (or a tenant admin role).

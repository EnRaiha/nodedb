//! Universal node-level "fan to all local cores and merge" primitive.
//!
//! `execute_plan_all_local_cores` is the canonical way to execute a
//! [`nodedb_physical::physical_plan::PhysicalPlan`] on THIS node and obtain a
//! single merged payload in exactly the same shape a single core's handler
//! produces. It is called:
//!
//! - by `exchange::received::execute_received_plan`, so that an inbound plan
//!   from another node is fanned across all local cores before the merged
//!   result is returned. A vShard-scoped transaction meta-op never reaches the
//!   fan: it runs on its one owning core, and the fan refuses it,
//! - by the local BSP scatter path (`bsp_pagerank/scatter.rs`) so the
//!   coordinator's own node is treated identically to every remote node.
//!
//! At 1 core/node the fan is over a single core and every path is
//! behaviour-identical to the prior single-core dispatch.
//!
//! `dispatch` holds the top-level plan-shaped routing plus the two generic
//! gather variants (row-array and single-blob). `fanout` holds the shared
//! per-core dispatch primitive used by every single-blob merge path.
//! `snapshot`, `bsp`, and `wcc` each hold one field-concatenation merge for a
//! single-blob `PhysicalPlan` variant. `read_cut` resolves the read cut a BSP
//! or WCC run reads the graph at, before `bsp` and `wcc` fan the plan.
//! `base_snapshot` keeps every core's image apart, by core id, for a base
//! snapshot.
//! `home_versions` asks each core for the home versions of the vShards it
//! owns.

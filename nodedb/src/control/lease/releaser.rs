//! Background release of leases that synchronous code gives up.
//!
//! A `Drop`, a metadata applier step, or any other synchronous site never
//! waits for a metadata proposal. It hands the release to [`LeaseReleaser`]
//! instead: a bounded queue owned by `SharedState`. One Control-Plane task
//! drains the queue, proposes each release, and retries a failed one with
//! backoff.
//!
//! A release that is never proposed, because the queue is full, every
//! attempt failed, or the node shut down, costs latency only. A descriptor
//! lease expires at its `expires_at`, and the renewal loop releases an idle
//! one at expiry. A DDL preparation lease is reclaimed by the metadata leader
//! once its lease window passed.

//! Write keys of a RESTORE batch.

//! A restored row locks what every point writer of the row locks: its
//! surrogate and its row id. A restored edge version locks what every edge
//! write locks: its surrogate pair and both endpoints' node lock pairs, on
//! both endpoint homes. So a restored write orders against every other
//! writer of the same row or edge, and against a node delete's guard.

//! The metadata leader's reclaim of a DDL preparation lease whose owner died,
//! left, or held it past its lease.
//!
//! One loop runs on every node and acts only while the node leads the
//! metadata group. A proposer waiting for the lease never reclaims it itself:
//! a waiter on a follower cannot judge the owner dead, and the leader can have
//! no DDL of its own. The loop covers both.

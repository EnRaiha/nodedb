//! `propose-and-wait-for-local-apply` helpers for replicated catalog DDL.
//!
//! The sole entry point DDL handlers use to write a
//! [`crate::control::catalog_entry::CatalogEntry`] through the metadata raft
//! group (group 0): `propose_catalog_entry_async` and
//! `propose_catalog_batch_async`. Both run on any runtime flavor. Every wait
//! is awaited: the preparation lock and lease, the descriptor drain, the
//! metadata commit's apply, and the authorization barrier.
//!
//! A preparation lease dropped unreleased, as when its proposer's future is
//! cancelled, hands its release to the background lease releaser. A release
//! that never applies ends when the metadata leader reclaims the lease: at
//! once when its owner left, once its owner is dead past the grace, and after
//! the lease time when its owner is alive but stuck.
//!
//! Every node runs a metadata raft group, a one-node cluster included.
//! `start_raft` installs its handle before any listener opens. A state with
//! no handle refuses the propose with a typed error. No caller writes the
//! catalog itself.
//!
//! Semantics:
//!
//! 1. If this node is the metadata-group leader, proposes the entry, waits
//!    until its local applied watermark reaches the assigned log index for
//!    as long as the apply moves (a 5s stall ends the wait), and returns the
//!    log index on success.
//! 2. If this node is NOT the leader, returns
//!    `Error::Config { detail: "metadata propose: not leader ..." }`.
//!    Gateway-side redirection will make this transparent.

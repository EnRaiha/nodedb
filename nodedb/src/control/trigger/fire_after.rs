//! AFTER trigger firing logic.
//!
//! Called after DML operations to fire matching AFTER ROW triggers.
//! Matches triggers by (collection, event), evaluates WHEN clauses,
//! and invokes the statement executor for each matching trigger body.
//!
//! Supports three execution modes via `mode_filter`:
//! - `Some(Sync)`: fire in the Control Plane write path
//! - `Some(Async)`: fire from Event Plane (eventually consistent)
//! - `Some(Deferred)`: fire at COMMIT time, batched
//! - `None`: fire all AFTER triggers regardless of mode
//!
//! A SYNC body joins the transaction of the write that fired it (`joined`):
//! the write and the body commit together or not at all. An ASYNC or
//! DEFERRED body runs in its own transaction: its writes commit together when
//! it succeeds and none apply when it fails.

//! Post-apply side-effect dispatcher.
//!
//! Dispatches per-variant side effects for `CatalogEntry` mutations on
//! **every node** (leader and followers). The match is exhaustive by design —
//! adding a new `CatalogEntry` variant without wiring a branch (even if that
//! branch is `()`) is a compile error.
//!
//! ## Applied-index contract for `PutCollection`
//!
//! `DocumentOp::Register` MUST complete before `apply` returns and before the
//! applied-index watcher bumps. Correctness depends on this: any subsequent
//! `DocumentOp::Scan` on the same node must find the collection registered in
//! `doc_configs` so Binary Tuple (strict) documents decode correctly.
//!
//! [`run_post_apply_async_side_effects`] awaits the Register dispatch, and
//! the metadata applier awaits it before it advances past the entry.
//!
//! Collection purge, materialized-view deletion, and the MOVE TENANT cutover
//! have the same ordering requirement: all local Data Plane cores must reclaim
//! the old incarnation before the applied-index watcher advances, because a
//! same-name re-CREATE can immediately follow. A reclaim that queued a durable
//! `_system.pending_reclaim` retry counts as done: the pending-reclaim worker
//! and the boot drain own it. A reclaim that queued nothing returns `Err`, the
//! metadata applier stops the batch at the entry, and the re-delivered entry
//! retries the reclaim.
//!
//! ## Applied-index contract for the vector-index variants
//!
//! `VectorOp::SetParams` and `VectorOp::DropIndex` MUST complete before the
//! applied-index watcher bumps. A vector write that lands first materializes
//! the index with default build parameters, and `execute_set_vector_params`
//! then refuses to reconfigure a materialized index — so a late `SetParams`
//! never applies and the node serves the wrong index for good. The same
//! refusal makes a late `DropIndex` block the same-name re-CREATE that can
//! follow it.
//!
//! ## Applied-index contract for the synonym-group variants
//!
//! `MetaOp::PutSynonymGroup` and `MetaOp::DeleteSynonymGroup` MUST complete
//! before the applied-index watcher bumps. `propose_catalog_entry` returns to
//! the DDL caller once the local watermark reaches the entry, so the client's
//! next query runs immediately after. A group that installs after that query
//! expands nothing, and a group that is deleted after it keeps expanding —
//! both answer with the wrong row set and no error, which no later dispatch
//! makes the client aware of.
//!
//! ## Durability for `CompactHistory`
//!
//! Apply records the owed compaction in `_system.pending_history_compaction`.
//! The fan-out is awaited, and the row is removed once every core compacted
//! and checkpointed. A failed fan-out keeps the row for the retry worker and
//! the boot drain, so it never stops the batch.
//!
//! Variants without a read-after-apply dependency remain fire-and-forget,
//! and only where boot rebuilds their effect from redb.

/// Applies join order optimization before execution: triples within each
/// PatternChain are reordered by selectivity (lowest edge count first,
/// bound variables preferred).
///
/// `frontier_bitmap`: when `Some`, only nodes whose surrogate is present in the
/// bitmap are eligible as pattern anchors. Bound variables (already resolved
/// from a prior binding row) bypass the bitmap check — only free-variable
/// anchor enumeration is restricted.
///
/// `is_remote_node`: when `Some(pred)`, `pred(node_name)` returns `true` for
/// nodes homed on a remote shard. Only nodes that (a) were reached via a
/// **bound** source variable (resolved from `input_row`, not free-ranged),
/// AND (b) satisfy this predicate, AND (c) have zero raw directional
/// adjacency, are added to `unresolved_frontier`.  Free-ranging anchors never
/// emit, even when the predicate and degree conditions hold, because each
/// shard's own pass covers all its local nodes.
/// Pass `None` (the production default on a fully-local CSR) to guarantee
/// an always-empty frontier, preserving byte-identical single-node behaviour.
///
/// `overlay`: when `Some(delta)` and the delta is non-empty, the query runs
/// inside a transaction and each fixed-hop triple observes the transaction's
/// own staged edge writes/deletes (read-your-own-writes) via the name-keyed
/// merge in [`super::overlay_expand`]. `None` (or an empty delta) is the
/// autocommit path and is byte-identical to committed-CSR-only execution.

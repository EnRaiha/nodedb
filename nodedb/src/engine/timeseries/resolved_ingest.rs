//! A timeseries ingest resolved to the exact rows it stores.
//!
//! Every timeseries ingest resolves once, before its log record exists: the
//! Data Plane parses the lines, evolves a scratch copy of the collection's
//! schema for them, and keeps each line the memtable accepts. A standalone
//! write resolves before its WAL append. A Raft proposal and a sequenced
//! transaction resolve on the node that proposes or submits them, never on
//! each replica. The record carries the result, and every install stores
//! exactly these rows. Restart replay and WAL catch-up read the same rows, so
//! the stored rows, the write events and the rebuilt events agree.
//!
//! A batch names the schema its rows were resolved against. A gate-admitted
//! live install whose collection schema no longer evolves to that schema
//! refuses the batch under [`TsDriftPolicy::Refuse`]: its record is
//! cancelled, and the writer resolves again. Every other install (a
//! committed log entry, a committed transaction, restart replay) never
//! refuses, and stores each value under its column name.

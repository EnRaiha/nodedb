//! Webhook delivery task: background Tokio task per webhook-enabled stream.
//!
//! Consumes events from the stream's buffer using an internal consumer group
//! (`_webhook:<stream_name>`), POSTs each event batch to the URL, and commits
//! offsets on success. In a cluster only the node that holds the leader lease
//! of the stream's owning group delivers. It reads every partition, from its
//! own buffer and from the members of groups it does not replicate. See
//! [`crate::event::cdc::sink_owner`] and [`deliver_event`] for the fencing and
//! idempotency headers. Failed deliveries retry with exponential backoff.

//! The transactional outbox of a trigger body's cross-node writes.
//!
//! A body's cross-node request commits in the body's own redo record, as a
//! committed message to a reserved topic, beside the body's writes and its
//! applied key. So the request is durable exactly when the body is: no queue
//! can refuse it after the body committed. Every replica of the record holds
//! it in the publish ledger, the partition's lease holder delivers it from the
//! replicated cursor, and the cursor passes it only once the receiver
//! answered. A new lease holder, or a restart, resumes from the cursor, and
//! the receiver's key applies a request sent twice once.

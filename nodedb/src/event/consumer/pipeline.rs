//! Deliver an event to every side effect.
//!
//! Events from the ring and events WAL catch-up rebuilt take the same path:
//! DML audit, the hold of the event's AFTER and DEFINE EVENT actions, then
//! the watermark, CDC, streaming materialized views and CRDT sync. A
//! committed transaction's publish event is held for delivery to its topic
//! instead. The guard admits each event once, so an event both paths carry
//! is delivered once.
//!
//! Every replica holds an event's actions. Only the partition's owner fires
//! them, from a replicated cursor (see `trigger::lane`).
//!
//! The permission cache is not a side effect here. The permission step runs
//! on ring events by their core numbers, before delivery (see
//! `control::security::permission_tree::event_handler`).

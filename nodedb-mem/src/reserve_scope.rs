//! RAII unwind scope for a multi-layer budget reservation.
//!
//! [`ReserveScope`] owns the rollback for a reservation spanning any subset
//! of the global, database, tenant, and engine counters. A caller credits
//! each layer as it succeeds and calls [`ReserveScope::commit`] once every
//! layer needed is credited. Dropping the scope before `commit` releases
//! every credited layer, in reverse order, so a caller never hand-writes a
//! rollback block for a failed layer.

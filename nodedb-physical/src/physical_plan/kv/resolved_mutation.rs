//! A KV write whose stored image depends on the stored row — an atomic
//! increment, a CAS, a field merge, a transfer — cannot cross the Raft wire
//! carrying a live write predicate: a follower has no writing identity to
//! decide it against. The Control Plane resolves the write against the rows
//! the Data Plane holds, decides the policy there, and ships the mutations
//! themselves.
